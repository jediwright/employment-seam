# Automerge Repo Keyhive (ARK)

`@automerge/automerge-repo-keyhive` adds end-to-end access control and
encryption to [automerge-repo](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo)
using the [keyhive](https://github.com/inkandswitch/keyhive) protocol.
Documents get member lists with ordered access levels (relay, read, edit,
admin), membership changes sync over a dedicated protocol, and document data
is encrypted so sync servers relay ciphertext they cannot read.

## Install

```
pnpm add @automerge/automerge-repo-keyhive
```

## Quickstart

Initialize a hive and its repo, connected to a subduction sync server:

```ts
import {
  Access,
  initializeAutomergeRepoKeyhive,
} from "@automerge/automerge-repo-keyhive";
import { Repo } from "@automerge/automerge-repo";
import { IndexedDBStorageAdapter } from "@automerge/automerge-repo-storage-indexeddb";

const { hive, repo } = await initializeAutomergeRepoKeyhive({
  createRepo: (config) => new Repo(config),
  storage: new IndexedDBStorageAdapter("my-app-keyhive"),
  peerIdSuffix: "my-app",
  syncServer: "keyhive", // the identity of keyhive.sync.automerge.org
  repo: {
    storage: new IndexedDBStorageAdapter(),
    subductionWebsocketEndpoints: ["wss://keyhive.sync.automerge.org"],
  },
});

// Documents created with `create2` use the repo's id factory, so they get a
// keyhive document id and are keyhive-protected. `repo.create` bypasses the
// id factory and produces an unprotected document.
const handle = await repo.create2({ title: "hello" });

// Let the sync server relay the (encrypted) document, then grant a
// collaborator access using the contact card they shared with you.
await hive.addSyncServerRelayToDoc(handle.url);
await hive.addMemberToDoc(handle.url, collaboratorContactCard, Access.edit());
```

## Documentation

- [API guide](docs/automerge-repo-keyhive-api-guide.md): the full public
  API, including initialization on both transports, identity and contact
  cards, membership and access, sync servers, bundler setup, and the
  storage layout.
- [Example app](https://github.com/inkandswitch/keyhive-todo-app-demo): a
  complete todo application built on ARK, including a reference Vite
  configuration.

## Status

Pre-release. The package currently pins forked prerelease builds of
automerge and automerge-repo (see `package.json`); the publishing story for
public consumers is still being finalized.
